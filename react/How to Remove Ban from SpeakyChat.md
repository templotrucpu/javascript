In this article, we will show you some methods that may help you unban yourself from SpeakyChat. However, please note that these methods are not guaranteed to work and may have some risks. Therefore, use them at your own discretion and responsibility.
 
## Method 1: Change your IP address
 
One of the most common ways that SpeakyChat bans users is by blocking their IP address. This means that if you try to access SpeakyChat from the same IP address that you got banned from, you will not be able to connect. Therefore, changing your IP address may help you bypass the ban and join SpeakyChat again.
 
There are several ways to change your IP address, such as using a VPN service, a proxy server, or a mobile hotspot. However, each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, using a VPN service may provide you with more security and privacy, but it may also slow down your internet connection or cost you some money. Using a proxy server may be free and fast, but it may also expose your data to third parties or be unreliable. Using a mobile hotspot may be convenient and easy, but it may also consume your data plan or battery life.
 
Therefore, you should choose the method that suits your needs and preferences best. Here are some steps on how to change your IP address using each of these methods:
 
- **Using a VPN service:**
    1. Download and install a VPN service of your choice on your device. There are many VPN services available online, both free and paid. Some of the popular ones are NordVPN, ExpressVPN, CyberGhost, etc.
    2. Launch the VPN service and choose a server location that is different from your current one.
    3. Connect to the VPN server and wait for it to establish a secure connection.
    4. Open SpeakyChat and try to join a chat room. You should be able to access SpeakyChat with a new IP address.
- **Using a proxy server:**
    1. Find a proxy server that works with SpeakyChat. You can search online for free proxy servers or use websites like hidemyass.com or proxysite.com.
    2. Copy the proxy server's IP address and port number.
    3. Open SpeakyChat and go to Settings > Connection > Proxy Settings.
    4. Check the box that says "Use proxy server" and paste the proxy server's IP address and port number in the corresponding fields.
    5. Click OK and try to join a chat room. You should be able to access SpeakyChat with a new IP address.
- **Using a mobile hotspot:**
    1. Turn on your mobile hotspot on your smartphone or tablet. Make sure you have enough data plan and battery life.
    2. Connect your device that has SpeakyChat installed to your mobile hotspot via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
    3. Open SpeakyChat and try to join a chat room. You should be able to access SpeakyChat with a new IP address.

## Method 2: Change your device ID
  
Another way that SpeakyChat bans users is by blocking their device ID. This means that if you try to access SpeakyChat from the same device that you got banned from, you will not be able to connect. Therefore, changing your device ID may help you bypass the ban and join SpeakyChat again.
  
To change your device ID, you will need to use a software tool that can modify your device's registry or system files. However, this method is more complicated and risky than changing your IP address. It may require some technical skills and knowledge, and it may also damage your device or cause some errors.
